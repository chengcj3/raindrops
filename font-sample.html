    <p class="copy">
      My dog, Butter, is a 6-year-old golden retriever / vegetable lover. Some of his favorites are broccoli, bok choy, and any kind of cabbage. He would show up instantly in the kitchen like a ghost if he heard me washing vegetables.

      I wish my appetite were as healthy as his (:
